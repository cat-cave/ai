/**
 * An ordinary function whose public name collides with a provider-native tool
 * must reach the provider as a plain function tool, keeping its schema.
 *
 * Before the runtime-discriminator fix the Gemini converter dispatched on
 * `tool.name`, so a user function called `google_search` was swallowed into
 * `{googleSearch: {...}}` and its `parameters` were lost entirely.
 *
 * Reading the assertion: aimock's `/v1/_requests` journal does NOT store the
 * raw provider body — the Gemini handler records the request already normalized
 * into the Chat-Completions envelope (`geminiToCompletionRequest`), which is why
 * the tool appears as `{type:'function', function:{...}}` rather than Gemini's
 * `functionDeclarations`. Do not "correct" this to the provider-native shape;
 * the journal cannot produce it.
 *
 * That normalization is exactly what gives the assertion teeth: only tools that
 * survive as functions appear in the journal, so a misrouted tool vanishes.
 * Verified against the pre-fix converter — the captured `tools` array comes
 * back empty and this expectation fails.
 *
 * The OpenAI leg of the same fix cannot be covered from this app; see the note
 * in `api.provider-tool-dispatch-wire.ts` for why, and
 * `packages/openai-base/tests/provider-tool-dispatch.test.ts` for where it is
 * covered instead.
