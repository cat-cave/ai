description: Use when writing, editing, or organizing documentation, when planning what docs a feature needs, and whenever planning or implementing a new feature or change in a repo (docs ship with the code). Also use when tempted to write docs without showing the discovered readers to the user, without asking for tone, or without loading simple-english and i-have-adhd. Triggers on "write docs for X", "document this feature", "add a guide", "update the docs", "reorganize the docs", "plan feature X", "implement X", or /docs.

# docs

Write docs a real person wants to read. Short, plain, built around someone trying to do a real thing.

"Document feature X" is not the job. "Help someone do Y with X" is the job.

Work in two phases. First plan the story: who reads this, what they want, and how many pages it should be. Then write.

The plan is not private. The user must see the readers and must choose the tone before any page is written.

```text
Find docs
  → read neighbors
  → Phase 1: readers + pages
  → PERSONA GATE (show the list, then stop)
  → TONE GATE (ask, then stop)          [when writing pages]
  → load simple-english + i-have-adhd   [when writing pages]
  → Phase 2: write
```

A doc-impact list in a feature plan still runs the persona gate. It does not run the tone gate or load the writing skills until pages are actually written.

## When to run

Docs ship with the code. Run this skill at three moments, not only when asked.

- Someone asks for docs. Write them.
- Planning a feature or change in a repo. Before the plan is done, list which docs are new and which need updating. This doc-impact list is part of the plan, the same as the code changes. Name the reader for each page.
- Finishing an implementation. Write or update those docs before you call the work done. A change to how something behaves that ships no doc change is not finished.

## Required skills for the final pages

`simple-english` and `i-have-adhd` are prerequisites. They apply to the documentation pages, not to this planning chat.

Load both immediately before writing page content. Use the Skill tool if this harness has one. If it does not, Read each skill's SKILL.md from the local skills directory. Do not write pages from memory of those skills.

If either skill is missing, stop and tell the user. Do not write the pages without them.

How they compose:

- This skill owns who the page is for, the page split, problem-then-fix, show-don't-tell, no history leak, forbidden glyphs, and neighbor structure.
- `simple-english` owns the sentences. Use pragmatic mode. Run its self-check before you call a page done.
- `i-have-adhd` owns the shape of the page: next action first, numbered steps, lists capped at 5 (split must vs later, or split the page), no preamble, a visible win at the end.

When `i-have-adhd` is loaded from this skill, apply it to the pages only. Do not switch the rest of the session into ADHD mode. The persistence section of `i-have-adhd` does not apply here.

## Find the docs first

Before writing anything, find where docs live.

1. Look for a docs folder. Check `docs/` first, then `documentation/`, `content/docs/`, `site/`, `website/docs/`.
2. Found nothing? Ask the user where docs should go. Do not guess and do not create a folder on a hunch.
3. Open 2 or 3 existing pages near where the new content belongs. Read them for copy, structure, frontmatter fields, and components. Note the apparent tone as a *candidate* for the tone gate. Do not adopt it yet.
4. Note which components the site already uses (steps, tabs, callouts, cards, accordions, code groups, and so on). Different sites have different ones.
5. Reuse those components to tell the story. If the site has a steps component, use it for walkthroughs. If it has tabs, use them for framework variations. If the site has none, use plain markdown. Never invent a component the site does not have.

If there is no page like the one you are about to write, read the closest one you can find and match it.

### What "match the neighbors" covers, and what it does not

Matching neighbors is about **copy, structure, frontmatter, and components**: whether headings are sentence case, how much setup a section gets, which components carry the walkthrough, how code samples are introduced, what the frontmatter fields are.

It is **not** a substitute for the tone gate. Neighbors can suggest a default. They cannot answer for the user.

It is **not** permission to copy a neighbor's bad habits. Everything in [Forbidden](#forbidden) and every rule in this skill still applies to the content you write, no matter what the surrounding pages do. An existing page full of em dashes does not license one more.

So: never reason "the other pages do it, so I will too" about a rule this skill states. If existing pages break a rule and you think the whole set should be brought in line, that is a separate cleanup to raise with the user, not something to settle by quietly matching the violation.

## Phase 1: plan the story

Do this before you write a word of content.

1. List who reads this and what each one wants. A person building on a React SPA, a person on a server-rendered app, someone who just wants a quick demo, someone extending the internals. Do not stop at the first reader.
2. Write one user story per reader: "As a X, I want to Y, so I can Z."
3. Turn stories into pages. One journey is one page. Different journeys are different pages. A feature with three real journeys is three pages plus maybe a short overview, not one giant page.
4. Check every reader has a path. A reader with no page is a hole in the plan. Add a page or a route for them.

The page split comes out of this step. Do not skip it.

### Gate: show the personas

<HARD-GATE>
The user must see the list. Listing readers in a thought, a todo, or a buried plan is not this gate.

After step 4, send a message that contains only:

1. Each reader, one user story, and the page you will write for them.
2. One question: confirm, drop a reader, or add one.

If the harness has an AskQuestion (or similar) tool, use it for that question. If it does not, use a numbered list.

Then pick one path:

**Default: stop.** This message is the entire turn. End the turn. Do not write files. Do not start Phase 2. Do not say you will proceed unless they object.

**Skip the wait: continue in this same turn.** Use this path only when one of these is true:

- This conversation already has the user's confirmation of this persona list.
- The user said "use sane defaults", "just write it", or "don't ask questions". Still SHOW the list in this turn, then continue.
- The change is a tiny copy edit: typo, broken link, code-fence language, or a factual fix. No new page, no new section, no rewrite of a journey.

On this path, do not end the turn. After you show the list (or after a tiny copy edit, with no list), continue to the next step.

These are not skips:

- "The readers are obvious."
- "The user asked for docs, so they do not want a question."
- "I already named them in the plan."
- "There is only one reader."
- "This is part of implementing a feature, keep going."

Writing docs is why this gate exists. It is not a reason to skip it.
</HARD-GATE>

## Less is more: split, do not cram

Do not force thousands of words into one page. Long pages hide the answer.

When a topic has several angles, give each its own short page and link them. A reader lands on the overview, then clicks into the exact thing they need.

Example. A feature for tool interrupts:

```text
Bad: one page
  interrupts.md   (overview + simple case + many interrupts + custom, all crammed in)

Good: a small set of linked pages
  interrupts/index.md            what it is, when to use it, links out
  interrupts/basic.md            one interrupt, start to finish
  interrupts/multiple.md         several interrupts in a flow
  interrupts/custom.md           build your own
```

Each page is short and does one thing. The overview stitches them into a story.

## Gate: ask for tone

This gate sits between Phase 1 and Phase 2. Run it before you write any page. Do not nest it inside Phase 2.

<HARD-GATE>
This gate runs before any page content is written. It does not run for a doc-impact list that is only a plan.

Neighbors can suggest a default. They cannot answer for the user.

Send a message that contains only:

1. The tone you inferred from neighboring pages, in one line (how formal, how much setup, second person or not).
2. One question with options: use that tone, more casual, more formal, or the user names another.

If the harness has an AskQuestion (or similar) tool, use it. If it does not, use a numbered list.

Then pick one path:

**Default: stop.** This message is the entire turn. End the turn. Do not write page content.

**Skip the wait: continue in this same turn.** Use this path only when one of these is true:

- This conversation already has the user's tone choice, including an explicit "match the existing pages".
- The user said "use sane defaults", "just write it", or "don't ask questions". Still STATE the inferred tone in one line, then continue.
- Tiny copy edit, same carve-out as the persona gate.

On this path, do not end the turn. After you state the tone (or after a tiny copy edit, with no question), continue to Phase 2.

These are not skips:

- "I can tell from the neighbors."
- "The site already has a voice."
- "Tone does not matter for a reference page."
- "I'll match neighbors and mention it later."
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase 2: write like a human

Do not write page content until the persona gate has passed, the tone gate has passed, and `simple-english` plus `i-have-adhd` are loaded.

The tone gate is the heading above this one. Run that gate first. Then load the two skills. Then write.

Legibility is the goal, above everything else.

- Keep it digestible. No walls of text, no huge paragraphs. Break ideas into small pieces. Give the smallest amount of info that does the job.
- Sentences follow `simple-english` (pragmatic mode). Do not inline a weaker substitute.
- Keep markdown light. Lists are fine. Bold headings on every line are not. Let the words carry the page.
- Prefer plain ASCII and normal keyboard characters over fancy glyphs. Write the way a person types.
- Second person, action first. Start with what the reader has now and what they will have at the end. No "In this guide we will explore..." openings. Just start.
- Shape the page with `i-have-adhd`: the first line is something the reader can do, multi-step work is numbered, a list longer than 5 is split, the page ends on a visible win.

### Lead with the problem, then solve it

Every page opens with the problem the reader came for, in their own words, before any API. Name the situation they are stuck in. Then say in a sentence or two how the feature solves it. Only after that do you go into the technical parts and the code.

A reader who sees the problem first knows in seconds whether they are on the right page. A reader who hits an API signature first has to reverse-engineer what it is even for.

The first line of the how is the next action (from `i-have-adhd`). The problem still comes first so they know they are on the right page.

```text
Bad:
  Call useInterrupts() and pass a resolver. The resolver runs once per
  pending item inside a transaction...

Good:
  Some tool calls shouldn't run without a human saying yes: moving money,
  deleting data. An interrupt pauses the run for that decision, then picks up
  where it left off. Here is how to gate a tool behind an approval:

  [code]
```

The order for a guide is problem, one-line fix, then the how (steps, snippets, API). Keep the problem to a couple of sentences, not a background essay. The code shows how it is solved, so do not narrate the solution in prose first.

### Show, do not tell

Do not explain in four paragraphs what one sentence and a code block can show. Readers grasp a diff or a snippet faster than prose.

```text
Bad:
  Three paragraphs describing how the config object accepts a
  middleware array, what each slot does, and how ordering works.

Good:
  Add your middleware to the `middleware` array. Order runs top to bottom:

  const app = createApp({
    middleware: [auth, logging],
  })
```

One good runnable example beats a page of description. Every code sample must run when copied, not need imagination to fill gaps.

### List anything that is a list

The moment a sentence covers more than one item, option, store, flag, or step, it becomes a list. Do not chain them into a paragraph with commas and semicolons. A reader scanning a bulleted list finds their item in a second. In a paragraph they have to read the whole thing to learn it does not apply to them.

The tell is a sentence that names two or more things and says something about each. Cut it into one bullet per thing, one or two sentences each.

```text
Bad:
  Each store is independent. Provide only the ones you need. For chat:
  `messages` for the transcript, `runs` for run lifecycle, `interrupts` for
  durable approvals (needs `runs`), `metadata` for namespaced key/value state.
  For generation: `generationRuns` for the run lifecycle, plus `artifacts` and
  `blobs` to keep generated bytes.

Good:
  Each store is independent, so provide only the ones you need.

  For chat:

  - `messages`: the transcript.
  - `runs`: run lifecycle.
  - `interrupts`: durable approvals. Needs `runs`.
  - `metadata`: namespaced key/value state.

  For generation:

  - `generationRuns`: run lifecycle for a generation.
  - `artifacts` + `blobs`: keep the generated bytes.
```

Which form to reach for:

- **Bullets** for a set where order does not matter: options, stores, fields, reasons, gotchas.
- **Numbered steps** for a sequence the reader performs in order.
- **A table** when every item has the same two or three attributes to compare (name, meaning, when to use).
- **A paragraph** only for a single idea that genuinely flows as prose. One thought, two or three sentences, no embedded set.

Keep bullets short and parallel: the same grammatical shape, the item in `code` or bold at the front, the explanation after it. A bullet that grows past two sentences wants to be its own subsection.

If a list grows past five items, split it. Put "do now" first. Put the rest on a later page, or under "later". That is the `i-have-adhd` cap, not a style preference.

### Page shape for a guide

Problem, fix, steps, done.

- Open with the problem the reader has, in their words, and what they will have at the end.
- Say in a sentence how the feature solves it.
- Walk through steps they can follow and test as they go, with the code doing the explaining.
- End when they reach the goal. Show what now works. Do not close with a vague "next steps" dump.

Reference pages (props, types, signatures) stay scannable and link back to the guide that shows them in use.

## Write for the reader, not the history

Docs describe what exists now. The reader never saw the old design, the earlier name, the draft PR, or the API you replaced along the way. Do not make them read about it.

Never justify the current API by comparing it to a version that did not ship. A line like "instead of `useAssistant`, this uses `usePlugin`, which makes more sense because..." is noise to someone who never knew `useAssistant` existed. Cut it and just describe `usePlugin`.

```text
Bad:
  We renamed useAssistant to usePlugin and moved the tools onto it,
  so instead of calling assistant.addTool you now use plugin.tools.

Good:
  Register tools on the plugin with plugin.tools:

  const plugin = usePlugin({ tools: [search] })
```

Ban this framing from the output: "instead of X", "we renamed", "previously called", "this replaces the old", "unlike the earlier", and any transitional name that never reached a release.

The one exception is a real migration. If users had X in a shipped, public release and you are moving them to Y, a short "Migrating from X" note is worth writing, because those readers actually used X. A name that only lived in a branch or a draft is not that. When unsure whether an old name shipped, leave it out.

## Don't leak the build process

The doc is read by someone who just arrived. They never saw the pull request, the refactor, or the conversation where the design was decided (including a conversation with an agent while writing the code and the docs). Write as if the current design was always the design. Anything that only makes sense to someone who watched it change is noise to the reader.

**Cut rejected alternatives.** If a discussion weighed option A against option B and picked B, the doc documents B. It never names A, never says B is "better than" A, never says A "is no longer needed." The reader is not choosing between them; they use what shipped.

```text
Bad:
  We use a plain JSON Schema here instead of zod, since it is lighter
  and zod is no longer a dependency.

Good:
  Pass the tool's input shape as a JSON Schema:

  [code]
```

**Do not explain what something is not, when the reader never thought it was.** If a piece moved out of a module during a refactor, the doc for its new home does not warn against the old arrangement. A reader who never knew locks lived inside persistence is only confused by a paragraph insisting locks are not a persistence store and must not be passed in as one. State what the thing is now, in its own terms.

```text
Bad (in the locks doc):
  Locks are not a persistence store. Do not pass a lock into the stores
  map. That used to be possible but is wrong now.

Good (in the locks doc):
  A lock coordinates work across instances. Wire it with withLocks:

  [code]
```

The test: read the sentence as a brand-new user. If it answers a question they would never ask ("wait, was this somewhere else before?") or defends a choice they never knew existed, delete it. The doc has no memory of how it got here.

## Forbidden

Never use these. Ever. This list has no exceptions: not "the neighboring pages use them", not "the repo's house style uses them", not "it reads better here".

- Em dashes and en dashes: the long `—` and the shorter `–`. Rewrite the sentence with a comma, colon, period, or parentheses instead.
- Separator glyphs like `×` or `·`.
- The pattern "It's not X: it's Y." and the "Not just X, but Y" three-part build-up.
- The phrases "key insight", "gap", and variations of them.

If you catch yourself reaching for one of these, stop and rewrite the sentence in plain words.

Before you call a page done, search your own added text for `—`, `–`, `×`, and `·`. If a hit survived, you rationalized it. Fix it. Flagging it in your summary is not a substitute for fixing it.

Then run the `simple-english` self-check on the same added text.

## Cross-linking and placement

- Put new pages where they fit the reader's path, grouped by what the reader is doing ("Building with React"), not by code layer ("Frontend Package API"). Update the site's nav or index so the page is reachable. An orphan page does not ship.
- Link related pages at the moment they help, inline in the flow, not as a "Related" dump at the bottom.
- Cross-linking goes both ways. When you add a page, update the older pages that should point into it.
- Do not over-link. One well-placed "need X? see Y" beats a list of maybes.

## Red flags

| You catch yourself | Do instead |
|---|---|
| Opening with an API signature or config before the problem | Name the problem the reader has first, then the one-line fix, then the code. |
| Writing three paragraphs before any code | Cut to one sentence plus a snippet. Show it. |
| Writing a sentence that names two or more things and explains each | Make it a bulleted list, one item per bullet. |
| A paragraph with commas or semicolons separating a set of options/stores/flags | Same fix: that is a list, format it as one. |
| Cramming every angle into one page | Split into short linked pages, one job each. |
| "In this guide we will explore..." | Delete it. Start with the reader's state and goal. |
| "Let me describe what this component does" | Describe what the reader does with it. |
| Reaching for an em dash | Rewrite with a comma, period, or parentheses. |
| "The surrounding pages do X, so I will too" where X breaks a rule here | Match neighbors on structure only. Follow this skill on everything it covers, and raise the existing violations as their own cleanup. |
| Using a big word (utilize, leverage, facilitate) | Swap in the plain word. `simple-english` owns this. |
| One page for everyone | Name the readers. Give each a path or a page. Show the list. Stop. |
| Posting a snippet "they can adapt" | Make it complete and runnable. |
| Guessing where docs go | Find the docs folder, or ask. Read neighbors first. |
| Calling a feature done with no doc change | If behavior changed, docs change too. Write them before you finish. |
| Planning a feature without a doc-impact list | Add the list of new and changed docs to the plan. Name the reader for each page. |
| "Unlike the old X, this now..." / "we renamed X to Y" | The reader never saw X. Describe only what ships now. |
| "we chose Y over zod because..." / "X is no longer needed" | Cut the rejected alternative. Document only what shipped, no comparison. |
| Warning readers not to do a thing they never knew was possible (e.g. "don't pass locks as a store") | Delete it. If they never saw the old arrangement, the warning only confuses. Describe the thing in its own terms. |
| Inventing a component the site lacks | Use only components the site already has. |
| Skipping the persona message because readers are obvious | Show the list. Stop. Obvious is not a skip. |
| Skipping the tone question because neighbors have a voice | Neighbors are the proposed default. Ask. Then stop. |
| Writing pages without loading simple-english and i-have-adhd | Load both. If either is missing, stop. |
| Treating "write the docs" as permission to skip the gates | Writing docs is why the gates exist. |
| Listing personas inside a larger plan and continuing | That is not the gate. The gate is a dedicated message that ends the turn. |
